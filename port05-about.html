                    <p>GALLERY SP started out as Seoul Print Work Shop, the first print work shop in Korea, in 1989.
                        When we moved to Chungdam-dong in 1998, it started to actively take on the structure of an art
                        gallery. And in 2006, we were reopened at the new location in Sinsa-dong and is currently
                        involved with the exhibition, planning and sales of contemporary art in various medium, such as
                        painting, sculpture, print and ceramic. </p>

                    <h3>Print</h3>
                    <p>We pay special attention to the emerging and mid-career artists by placing their works as the
                        center of the exhibitions as well as promoting their work internationally through international
                        art fairs. Since 2000, we have installed art works in large-scale architectural space such as
                        hotels, hospitals and government offices, and we continually perform art consulting. In
                        addition, Seoul Print Work Shop, Which has been producing about 20,000 print works, still
                        actively plans and produces print works of promising artists and supplies them broadly through
                        regular print fairs.</p>
